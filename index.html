        My name is Daniel Osornio I am 23 years old and currently studying to
        become a front end web developer. I have always been interested in
        computers whether it be with computer games,video games and movies such
        as The Matrix and Hackers also helped me make a decision to make a jump
        and try to become a programmer. I figured the best way to be able to
        accomplish this was with some schooling to be able to get my foot in the
        door at my first tech job. I really wanted to do this because I always
        have wanted to build a computer program that can be useful for a variety
        of people. One other thing that really intrigued me was the fact you
        have to always be learning to succeed in this field as things are always
        changing which I liked the idea of keeping stuff fresh. I believe
        technology should be accessible to everyone regardless of background as
        myself I am coming from a non tech job trying to make the transition. I
        enjoy working out and doing just about anything active or outdoors life
        is about balance.
